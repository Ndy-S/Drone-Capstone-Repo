# Drone (Drop & Done) Capstone Project
This repository contains the code for the Drone (Drop & Done) Capstone Project, a laundry app that aims to provide an on-demand laundry service. The project is developed as part of a capstone that combines three learning paths: Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, and Mobile Development.

### Overview
The Drone (Drop & Done) app allows users to schedule a laundry pickup and delivery from the comfort of their home or office. The app uses machine learning algorithms to optimize laundry recommendation using collaborative-filtering by utilizing sentiment analysis of each laundry reviews, ensuring that customers demand are fulfilled as efficiently as possible. Cloud computing services are used to store and process the data needed for the app, while mobile development is used to build the user interface and experience.
